The current security rules in [firestore.rules](firestore.rules) and assertion in [test.js](test/test.js) show how to write unit tests. It asserts that a user should only be able to access a cluster if their `uid` exists in the target cluster's `users` array.

```
npm install

npx firebase emulators:start --only firestore
